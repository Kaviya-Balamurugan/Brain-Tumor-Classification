# Brain Tumor Classification using MobileNetV2

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on classifying brain MRI images into multiple tumor
categories using a deep learning model based on **MobileNetV2**.
To improve model interpretability, **Grad-CAM** is used to visualize
important regions influencing predictions.
